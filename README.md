# Bank_Churn-Problem

The project assists in predicting whether a customer of a bank will churn based on their information. It employs machine learning to identify patterns in customer behavior.

🔍 What This Project Does
- Tends to predict whether a customer will churn from the bank
- Utilizes information such as age, balance, credit score, etc.
- Processes unbalanced data through under/over sampling
- Trains a model with SVM (Support Vector Machine)

🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

📈 Steps Followed
1. Cleaned and explored the data
2. Encoded text data into numbers
3. Created a new feature: Zero Balance
4. Handled unbalanced classes
5. Scaled the data
6. Trained and tested the model

✅ What I Learned
- How to preprocess and prepare data
- How to handle unbalanced datasets
- How to implement and train a machine learning model
- Got practical exposure during internship

**It was a good experience working on this project and learning new things. Looking forward to applying these skills in actual work.
